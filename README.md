Task 1 and Task2 work is stored under "Task" folder.

Task 3 - The code can be cloned and run for testing

Approach taken for automation testing :
- Identified the redriect links as a candidate for automation because we have more than one link
- So went with a data-driven approach in which all the links and expected text in redirect page is stored in excel.
note: For now, it can be seen the first two column of excel is same , but that approach was taken to make sure the code will work fine even if we decide to have different text in the redirected page
